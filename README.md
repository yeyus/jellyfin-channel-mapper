# jellyfin-channel-mapper

This channel mapper will extract all EPG data providers and Tuner Channels in your jellyfin server and match them with a fuzzing algorithm.

There are two commands available. Import the list of channels and perform the fuzzing to a CSV file. Export such CSV file to the server in the form of mappings.

I recommend going through the file in case some matches are not correct.
